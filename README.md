** panicroom is a backup tool for Adobe Lightroom **

This is work in progress

## PURPOSE

I tend to not backup my raw images as often as I should. One of the reasons is the massive amount of data that has to be moved to backup a large collection of images. To make backups faster, I could start deleting photos from the library. However I'd like to stick with my policy of never deleting any frame I ever shot.
A solution would be to only backup the 'good' photos. If the other's are eventually lost, I would probably be able to get over it. Some day.

## TODO

- lists absolute paths of master images in a lightroom catalog
- filters this list by RootFolder, Flags and Rating
- uses rsync to copy referenced files to a save place
- moves local files to a remote file server for archiving (this requires write access to the Lightroom catalog and is therefor dangerous)
